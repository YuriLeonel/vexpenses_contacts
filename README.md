## 🎨 Design Patterns & Best Practices

### **Clean Architecture**

- **Feature-based organization** - Logical grouping of related components
- **Service layer pattern** - Separation of business logic from UI
- **Custom hooks** - Reusable state logic and side effects

### **Type Safety**

- **Strict TypeScript** - Comprehensive type definitions
- **Interface segregation** - Specific interfaces for different contexts
- **Type-safe API calls** - Fully typed service layer

### **Form Handling**

- **Schema-driven validation** - Centralized validation logic
- **Optimized re-renders** - Efficient form state management
- **Accessible forms** - Proper ARIA attributes and error handling

### **Error Handling**

- **Error boundaries** - Graceful error recovery
- **User feedback** - Clear error messages and loading states
- **Fallback UI** - Consistent error presentation

### **Performance**

- **Lazy loading** - Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- **Memoization** - Preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Debounced search** - Optimized search performance
